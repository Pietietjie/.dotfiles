# .dotfiles

My personal dotfile config

## Steps

1. run `./install`

2. run `./getnf/getnf` and select the Nerd Font that you wish to install

## TODO

- system preferences
- Make a checklist of steps to decommission your computer before wiping your hard drive.
- Integrate other cloud services into your Dotfiles process (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.).
- Find inspiration and examples in other Dotfiles repositories at [dotfiles.github.io](https://dotfiles.github.io/) or [nvim for Laravel lady](https://github.com/jessarcher/dotfiles).
- figure out how to use sparse checkout with git submodules [lead](https://gist.github.com/Anmo/02c021bdd159f5962963)
